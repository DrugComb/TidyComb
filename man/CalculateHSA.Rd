\title{Calculate HSA synergy score}
\usage{
CalculateHSA(response.mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{response.mat}{A drug cobination dose-response matrix. It's column name
and row name are representing the concerntrations of drug added to column and
row, respectively. The values in matrix indicate the inhibition rate to cell
growth.}
}
\value{
A matrix for synergy score calculated via Highest Single Agent (HSA).
}
\description{
\code{CalculateHSA} calculates the synergy score matrix for a block of
drug combination by using Highest Single Agent (HSA) reference model.
}
\details{
This model is a reference model for evaluating the interaction between two
drugs. The basic assumption of this model is "The reference effect of drug
combination is the maximal single drug effect".
