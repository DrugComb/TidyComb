\alias{GetDisease}
\title{Extract the disease information of one cell line.}
\usage{
GetDisease(node)
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{An XMLInternalElementNode with only one cell line's information
which was extracted from Cellosaurus xml file.}
}
\value{
A data frame contains two variables:
\item{disease}{name of the cell line associated disease.}
\item{disease_id}{NCI Thesaurus entry code of the associated disease.}
}
\description{
\code{GetDisease} extracts the cell line associated diseases and NCI
Thesaurus entry code from one \code{cell-line-list} node in Cellosaurus xml
file.
}
\details{
This function extract the cell line associated disease and disease ID (NCI
Thesaurus entry code) which the cell line associated with from an
XMLIntervalElementNode object extracted from Cellosaurus xml file. Combining
this function with \code{\link[base]{apply}} or \code{\link[base]{sapply}}
can extract disease information from an XMLNodeSet object.
}
\examples{
node <- GetAllCell(system.file("extdata", "cellosaurus.xml", package = "TidyComb"))
cell <- GetCell(node, c("U251", "U87"), "name")

# get first cell line associated disease and disease ID
disease <- GetDisease(cell[[1]])

# get all cell lines associated diseases and disease IDs
diseases <- sapply(cell, GetDisease)
}
