\item{response.mat}{A drug cobination dose-response matrix. It's column name
and row name are representing the concerntrations of drug added to column and
row, respectively. The values in matrix indicate the inhibition rate to cell
growth.}

\description{
\code{CalculateBliss} calculates the synergy score matrix for a block of
drug combination by using a druginteraction reference model introduced by
C. I. Bliss in 1939.
}
\details{
This model is a reference model for evaluating the interaction between two
drugs. The basic assumption of this model is "The expected effect of two
drugs acting independently". More details about this model could be found in
