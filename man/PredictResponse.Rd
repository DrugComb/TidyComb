\title{Predict response value at certain drug dose}
\usage{
PredictResponse(df, dose)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame. It contains two variable:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{dose} a serial of concentration of drug;
  \item \strong{response} the cell line response to each concentration of
  drug. It should be the inhibition rate according to negative control.
}}

\item{dose}{A numeric value. It specifies the dose at which user want to
predict the response of cell line to the drug.}
}
\value{
A numeric value. It is the response value of cell line to the drug at
inputted dose.
}
\description{
\code{PredictResponse} uses \code{\link[drc]{drm}} function to fit the dose
response model and generate the predict response value at the given dose.
}
\details{
\strong{Note}: Random number generator used in \code{AddNoise} with
\code{method = "random"}. If the analysis requires for reproductiblity,
plesase set the random seed before calling this function.
